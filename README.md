# Simple website template
My aim with this template is to make a simple HTML website, that anyone with no coding experience at all could use for their own site. Hopefully the comments on the `index.html` page and the `style.css` page will help you out! It is super simple, minimalistic and hopefully pretty useful!

Comments can be found on the `index.html` page. I've also added comments to the `syle.css` page.

If you want to host your website completly free, I recommend [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/928694.html). I use it for a few of mine, and it is great. Obviously, you could just use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), but I have found that images are not supported very well, and often problems can occur.
